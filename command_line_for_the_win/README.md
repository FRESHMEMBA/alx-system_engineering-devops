Command line for the win

To complete this project, I did the following:
-Opened a terminal in my local machine and changed the directory to where my screenshots are saved;
-Executed the command: 'sftp username@host', username is the name of my sandbox, and host is the host of/for my sandbox (as provided in the Sandboxes tab in the intranet website);
-Then I was prompted for the password, I copied the password from the intranet (Sandboxes) and entered it into the terminal;
-I execued the command 'put filename' for each screenshot, where filename is the name of the respective screenshot, i.e. 0-first_9_tasks.png;
-Then I entered the 'exit' command to exit the sftp.
